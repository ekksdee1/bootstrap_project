                    In the late 1800s, there was a mass emigration to the United States from Italy, in which about 5 million 
                    people arrived in the states. With all of these people, the Italian culture was brought to the states, 
                    and along with their culture came their food!
                </p>

                <p class="indent"> 
                    The Italians brought pizza, which is why pizza is so common in the U.S. today, even if it is Americanized 
                    pizza. It quickly became a hit in the early 1900s, as an inexpensive, hot, and delicious food. The Italians 
                    also brought the long sandwich to the states, and that evolved into the well-known sub. You could even make 
                    an argument that Subway only exists because the Italians brought the long sandwich to the U.S!

                <p class="indent">
                    Italian ingredients were brung to the U.S. so that they could be readily available at a later date though;
                    it wasn't until the Mediterranean Food revolution that ingredients such as olive oil and dried pasta were 
                    easily available to the public outside of Italy. It's also important to mention that a reputation was made
                    for Italian restaurants, in that they were romantic and classy restaurants where a couple could go to eat.
                    This is seen even today, where restaurant chains such as Olive Garden are somewhat classy.
